# Class-Work-with-R
Analysis I've done using R for my classes

The work I've done here have either been for class projects, or class articles. Unfortunetly, I cannot share those pieces. 
That said, I can provide some of the R code that I've used, so each file, is typically for a different project. 

As a journalism student, I have never been taught R in any of my classes. I am self taught, and I try to convince my teachers to allow me use the language for my projects involving data and analysis, in order to improve my skills.
